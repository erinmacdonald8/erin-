<p>Eventing is the ultimate equestrian challenge comprised of dressage, show jumping and cross country. It can be likened to a triathlon, with horses and riders demonstrating a range of skills across the three disciplines.
 To compete successfully in eventing combinations must show harmony and rhythm in the dressage, balance and precision in the show jumping and accuracy and bravery in the cross country phase. The combination with the lowest penalty score at the end of the event is the winner.
 As horses and riders move up the levels, the difficulty and technicality of the phases increases. Riders can compete from the year of their 10th birthday and there is no upper age limit.</p>

<p>Riders must be in the year of their 10th birthday or older to compete with British Eventing and horses must be at least five years old (unless they are competing in the specific four year old classes).
 To compete at BE80 and BE90 level, horses must be 132cm. For national pony classes, ponies must be at least 142cm and not exceed 148cm without shoes. </p>

<p> BE80 is the introductory level of the sport, the maximum height of show jumping fences are 85cm and 80cm for cross country fences.  Some events may offer a BE80(T) class. 
The 'T' stands for training, and competitors may have access to a BE Accredited Coach at the events that offer such a class, such as course walks or warm up support.
</p>

<p>BE90 level competition sees a maximum height show jump at 95cm and the cross country is a maximum of 90cm. </p>

<p>BE100 classes have a maximum height show jumping of 105cm and cross country of 100cm </p> 

<p>BE100 Plus classes are a step up from BE100 before BE105, they have a Novice level dressage test but a BE105 level show jumping and BE100 level cross country</p>

<p>BE105 is a bridge between BE100 and Novice classes. The dressage test is Novice level and the maximum height of fences for the show jumping is 110cm and for the cross country is 105cm.</p>
